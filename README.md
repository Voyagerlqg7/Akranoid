# Akranoid
Qt framework simle project
Code comments only on russian language 

My Qt version 6.7.0 and CMake verison 3.24.3

If you have empty main window you should copy "texture" 
folder into build folder where you have .exe file. 

If you are having trouble building project, you should probably reconfigure the paths to Qt in CmakeLists.txt or change versions in CmkeLists file and qt.cmake.
